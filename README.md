Download the entire Quixel Bridge assets libraries and add them to your account (does not download each asset to your computer, do that from the app)


Go to the https://quixel.com/megascans/home and then hit F12 to open the dev console. 
Next go to the Console section near the bottom and paste my script into it. This will not only fetch every single asset, but add it to your account for free. If it errors or gives you a 403 Forbidden error, don't worry wait ~10 minutes and try again. The error happens when you overuse their query system, and this is typical around 10,000 items added to your account. 

Keep in mind that this script does not do anything it should not, and its perfectly legal.

Thanks for reading and good luck devs!
